## Clarifying questions

- “Equip GCs with the means to SEND files to their subs.” The image shows a contractor is able to have folders of their own. How is access granted to subs and who can actually see the folder?

- Where are contractors and subcontractors located? Is it just in the SF area or is it worldwide?
